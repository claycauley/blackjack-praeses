Blackjack Mockup for Praeses

###Design Decisions 
#Layout
I designed this interface with this particular layout because it places some of the most important information up at the top and makes it easy to see. Some people who may stumble upon this webapp might have never played Blackjack before, so having a "Rules" button that is persistent could help someone easily figure out the game. Or if there are special rules associated with this version of BJ, having a place where those are clearly outlined would cause less frustration for the user.

It's also using the accented secondary golden color because it contains your current chip count. Color association between gold and wealth or money played a role in this choice.

Under that, I opted to first put the dealer's hand. Since you have no control over what the dealer does and because this is a similar layout to a typical casino table, where the dealer sits across or in front of you. The label for the dealer's hand is clearly marked as well as his current total. Since the dealer starts with one card face down, this was conveyed through the design as well.

After that, you have the player's (your) hand. I opted here to have the cards closer together so it could be seen as more of a "duel" rather than being separated by the label/card total, which I moved under the cards here and closer to the player. This also allows for you to easily see your card total next to your action buttons for Hitting, Standing, or Doubling Down, reducing the amount of "eye darting" to find the information on the screen.

The dealer area and player area are also broken up with varying shades of the primary green color. More on color choices further down.

In the "action" section, you have the top two options for Hit and Stand front and center. With Double Down underneath taking the full width because Doubling Down is a larger risk (with potentially a larger reward), it received more screen real estate to convey that idea.

Finally the Quick Tips section was just an added bonus to fill in some space with randomly populated tips for players to potentially help them learn the game or better their skills.

#Color Choice
When choosing colors for this interface, I instantly knew I needed a green. Green is very commonly associated with money, but it's also the color of the felt that covers blackjack tables. To accent the shades of green, I went with gold, which is also commonly thought of with wealth and finance. Green and gold pair well together anyway, but when considering the subject matter, it makes even more sense. A game about money using colors often associated with money/wealth was easy enough to decide on, but what about one more accent color? Another pop of something more?

Red. Not an overpowering red, but a dusty, muted red. The diamond and heart suit icon was already going to need some shade of red, so I searched for one that complemented the gold AND the green but also played nice with my text combinations. Not the easiest thing to do with a red.

So while the majority of the color scheme is green and gold, red makes its appearance as an accent color for negative toast messages for losing hands. Red is often seen as a color for warnings or errors, so you want to avoid using it for something unfamiliar to users. It may lead to confusion where there doesn't need to be any.

There you can see where I initially started this design process **(Initial Concepts / Colors / Typography)** using shades of black and gray before evolving it out. You can also see the various steps of the evolution as new ideas popped into my head to help refine the overall design.

If you take a look at **Final Page Flow** you can see every step of the design process. How you initiate a bet, what busting looks like, what winning looks like, how the rules are displayed, player statistics, what a push would look like. I tried to cover every scenario I could think of with a design matching it.

**Prototype Examples** will help better illustrate how the flow would look. While not 1:1 with what I envision the animation would look like the basic idea is there to help you get a sense of what I was going for.
