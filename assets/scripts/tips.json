  "The dealer is required to <strong>hit</strong> on any total of 16 or less and must <strong>stand</strong> once they reach 17 or higher.",
  "There is no splitting cards in this game. Play doubles straight up.",
  "If the dealer shows 7 or higher, play with caution. They can often reach 17+ and take your money. Which is no good for you.",
  "<strong>Doubling Down</strong> on 10 or 11 can be a strong move when the dealer has a weak upcard. Increase your chance for more winnings!",
  "A natural blackjack (Ace + 10-value card) pays 1.5x your bet and is an instant win unless the dealer also has a blackjack.",
  "<strong>Hit</strong> means you want another card. <strong>Stand</strong> means you want to keep your current total and end your turn. Hit as much as you want, just don't bust!"
